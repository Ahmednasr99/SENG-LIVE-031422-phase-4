 - O(1) Constant 
 - O(n) Linear time
 - O(log n) [Logarithmic time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ubFru2O80) 
 - O(n^2) Quadratic time 
 - O(n^n) Exponential time

 ### Popular DS and A
 - Arrays 
 - LinkedList
 - Hash
 - Stacks/Queue 
 - Trees 
    - Binary 
 - Graphs 

 ### How to approach a DS and A question

 - Write the question down and confirm your assumptions  
 - Write out/explain steps for the solution before coding 
 - Code out solution 
 - Run test case examples 
 - Give Big - O
